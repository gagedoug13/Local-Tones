## Neighborhood JAMZ
  Neighborhood JAMZ is a concert finding app that helps you find concerts in your area by plugging in your location and a date that you'd like to see concerts. I got the idea 
  for this when I was looking for shows in my area and realized other websites only show the big concerts in my city, not the cozy smaller ones in my area. This application was 
  built using React on the front end and Node to handle the requests safely and properly on the back end. 

## Getting Started
  After cloning this repository, you'll need to install all depencencies and be sure that node and react are fully updated on your machine. The next step will show you what exactly needs to be installed to run this application.
  
## Prerequisites
### npm install
installs all depependencies listed in package.json

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
